# Cleaning up organizational teams

Over time, the GitHub organization may become cluttered with old users and alumni who no longer code for the team.  Therefore, they don't need access either, but it's nice to keep them around.  To keep things neat, moving them to the Alumni team change there access permissions to read only (they can still _fork_, make _pull requests_, and file issue reports), similar to a normal person from the internet.

> Note: This process is very similar to what is described in [How to Add New Members - Adding people to a team](../quickGuides/membersQuickSetup); just removing members instead of adding them.

## Removing Members from Teams

1. Navigate to the [Teams tab](https://github.com/orgs/frc6506/teams)
1. Click on the team you would like to manage.
1. Click on the `Members` tab.
1. Use the check boxes to select the members you would like to remove.
1. Click the selection dropdown at the top and select 'Remove from team...'
1. Now, add them the appropriate team, such as the `alumni` team by following [How to Add New Members - Adding people to a team](../quickGuides/membersQuickSetup).
