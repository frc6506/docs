# Cleaning up organizational teams

Over time, the GitHub organization may become cluttered with old users and alumni who no longer code for the team.  Therefore, they don't need access either, but it's nice to keep them around.  To keep things neat, moving them to the Alumni team change there access permissions to read only (they can still _fork_, make _pull requests_, and file issue reports), similar to a normal person from the internet.
