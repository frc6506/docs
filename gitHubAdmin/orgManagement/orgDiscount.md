# Nonprofit discount for GitHub Organizations

Although our team doesn't code enough to truly need it, the free upgrade to the 'GitHub Team' plan is still nice to have over the free plan.  It also means that we don't have to worry about running into caps for various things.  Our nonprofit status may need to be reverified every year.

## Verify Status of Nonprofit Discount

1. Navigate to [Setings > Billing > Payment Information](https://github.com/organizations/frc6506/settings/billing/payment_information)
2. Under `Coupon`, it should say "100% off forever".
