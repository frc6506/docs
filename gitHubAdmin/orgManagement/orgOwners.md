# Organization Owners and Admins

In order to keep everything running smoothly and ensure the team has a place to archive and look back on previous coding work, it is important to ensure that the team retains control of our GitHub Organization.  This means removing old admins and adding new ones.  As the team it's own owner account, the organization's primary owner needs to also be passed on at the end of each year before those that leave the team become unreachable.  Additionally, it is good to have more than one owner.
