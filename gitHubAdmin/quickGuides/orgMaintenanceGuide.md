# Organization Maintenance, Removing Clutter, and keeping things running smoothly

## Access Control and Cleaning Up Organizational Teams

Over time, the GitHub organization may become cluttered with old users and alumni who no longer code for the team.  Therefore, they don't need access either, but it's nice to keep them around.  To keep things neat, moving them to the Alumni team change there access permissions to read only (they can still _fork_, make _pull requests_, and file issue reports), similar to a normal person from the internet.

## Passing on Organization Ownership

In order to keep everything running smoothly and ensure the team has a place to archive and look back on previous coding work, it is important to ensure that the team retains control of our GitHub Organization.  This means removing old admins and adding new ones.

## Free Upgrade for Organization

Although our team doesn't code enough to truly need it, the free upgrade to the 'GitHub Team' plan is still nice to have over the free plan.  It also means that we don't have to worry about running into caps for various things.  Our nonprofit status may need to be reverified every year.
