# How to Add New Members

This guide will explain how to add new members to the GitHub organization and then add them to the appropriate team.

## Adding people to the GitHub organization

> This section is for adding a team member.  If you want to add an `outside collaborator` to keep things neat, such as for a mentor, the process is slightly different.

> You will need to know everyone's GitHub username to complete this guide, or at least the email that they signed up for GitHub with.

4. The person invited should get an email notification.  It should also show up on [github.com](https://github.com) when they log in
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 as necessary to add everyone.

## Adding people to a team

Now that people are part of the GitHub organization, they still needed to be added to a team in order to simply access control.

> This section mostly assumes that one is adding regular members to the `CORE` team for example purposes, however it is not hard to select a different team instead.

1. Navigate to [github.com/orgs/frc6506/teams](https://github.com/orgs/frc6506/teams) in a browser, either directly or by clicking on `Teams` tab.
2. Click on the team you want to edit to go to that team's home/profile page.  For example, the `CORE` team should contain all of the current programmers.  Here is a diagram of the available teams:
