# GitHub Admin Overview

As a GitHub.com admin, you will:

- assist with keeping the team going smoothly, even when things go wrong
- Facilitate working on multiple features simultaneously from separate computers by separating development into _branches_, which are then _merged_ together with a _pull request_.
- maintain the code's history with `git`, a version control tool
- ensure the code is backed the code to `github.com` (_committing_ the code to the repository and then _pushing_ the code to GitHub)
- Enable the above to be completed by ensuring that the team's GitHub organization account is maintained and prepared for each season.

`git` software and GitHub are real world tools used by professionals and many open source projects.
